' Developer Express Code Central Example:
' How to display data which is being updated on another thread
' 
' Let's suppose that your data is being updated on another thread, by the timer in
' this example. You should take a special action to correctly reflect those
' changes in the grid - wrap them inside BeginDataUpdate/EndDataUpdate
' calls.
' When using the MVVM pattern, it is not possible to call grid's methods
' directly from the view model. Your view model can provide additional events to
' expose such changes of its state to the view. There are OnAsyncProcessingStarted
' and OnAsyncProcessingCompleted events in this example. Now you can handle these
' events in the view and force the grid to stop/start listening for data updates
' before/after asynchronous data modifications.
' Please note even though this
' approach requires several code lines in View's code-behind, ViewModel in this
' situation is completely independent from GridControl. Thus, this approach
' conforms the MVVM pattern.
'
